                        <p>To Whom it may concern</p>

                        <p>I just completed my BCom degree in Informatics Information Systems at the
                            University of Pretoria and am seeking opportunities to highlight my expertise in systems
                            development.</p>

                            <p>
                                My degree has equipped me with a strong foundation in full stack development, particularly in
                                ASP.Net core and Angular frameworks, and SQL for database management. I also have training in
                                Statistics and Data Science, with proficiency in languages and frameworks like SAS, R and Python for
                                Machine learning, Data and Regression analysis. Additionally, I have extensive training in system
                                analysis and documentation. My GitHub portfolio showcases some of the projects I have undertaken,
                                and I pride myself on delivering high-quality solutions with innovative code, utilizing UX/UI/Front end
                                development and engineering Web API's.
                            </p>

                            <p>I am passionate about the IT field, and my work speaks to my problem-solving, critical thinking, and
                                teamwork skills. My GitHub portfolio shows my recent work on a workflow management system for
                                the national Department of Agriculture, Land Reform, and Rural Development. The project
                                demanded high-quality coding, and utmost security, and my team and I were able to deliver both.</p>

                                <p>In pursuit of continually learning, I am consistently updating my skills and knowledge through short
                                    courses such as MS Azure certificates. I believe that my experience and skills will best suit your
                                    organization while fulfilling the requirements for the role I am applying for.</p>

                                    <p>Please find my contact details and my GitHub portfolio link in my attached CV. I look forward to
                                        discussing my qualifications further.</p>
